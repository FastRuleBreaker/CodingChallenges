# Coding Challenges

Collection of Coding Challenges from various software companies.

All of the challenges were received after applying to a "Senior" position.

I have not taken the time to organize the files and directories, yet?

In general, solutions are categorized in different directories.

Some are unsolved.

Some "take home" assignments had multiple parts to complete.

Some of the directories contain the HTML from the website used for the online challenge,
you can open these HTMLs and see the complete environment in which the test was taken.

If you are a software developer, then I made this repository for you, but always remember, 
your skills are more important and valuable than an online test
can ever evaluate.

However, if you are in charge of sending "coding tests" to potential hires and a repository like
this one bothers you, then please reconsider your notion of **value** in a software developer.

Lets just say it takes more time to solve the test than it takes to formulate it.

There is no guarantee that the solutions in this repository are correct.

For `/devskiller` tests, go to the `devskiller-tests-incomplete-initial-state` branch to see the initial state of the tests.

- The `/devskiller/nodejs` is complete on master branch
- The `/devskiller/reactjs` is passes 1 of the 4 tests suites on master branch
